# JavaScript Methods and this Keyword

## - JavaScript Methods

A method is a function that is a property of an object. For example, the `toUpperCase()` method is a function that is a property of the `String` object. It is used to convert a string to uppercase.

```js
let string = "hello";
console.log(string.toUpperCase()); // HELLO
```

## - JavaScript this Keyword

The `this` keyword refers to the object that the method belongs to. For example,

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  },
};

person.greet(); // Hello, my name is John
```

In the above example, the `this` keyword refers to the `person` object. It is used to access the `name` property of the `person` object.
