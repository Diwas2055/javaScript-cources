# JavaScript Getter and Setter

In JavaScript, there are two kinds of object properties:

- Data properties
- Accessor properties

## 1. Data Properties
Here's an example of data property that we have been using in the previous tutorials.
```js
const student = {

    // data property
    firstName: 'Monica';
};
```

## 2. Accessor Properties
In JavaScript, accessor properties are methods that get or set the value of an object. For that, we use these two keywords:

-   `get` - to define a `getter` method to get the property value
-   `set` - to define a `setter` method to set the property value
```js
const student = {
    firstName: 'Monica',

    // accessor property
    get fullName() {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    },

    set fullName(value) {
        const parts = value.split(' ');
        this.firstName = parts[0];
        this.lastName = parts[1];
    }
};
```

### 2.1. Getter Method
The `get` keyword is used to define a getter method. A getter method is used to get the value of an object. For example,
```js
const student = {
    firstName: 'Monica',

    // getter method
    get fullName() {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
};
```
In the above example, the `fullName` property is a getter method. It is used to get the full name of the student. To get the value of the `fullName` property, we use the following syntax:
```js
console.log(student.fullName); // Monica Geller
```

### 2.2. Setter Method
The `set` keyword is used to define a setter method. A setter method is used to set the value of an object. For example,
```js
const student = {
    firstName: 'Monica',

    // setter method
    set fullName(value) {
        const parts = value.split(' ');
        this.firstName = parts[0];
        this.lastName = parts[1];
    }
};
```
In the above example, the `fullName` property is a setter method. It is used to set the full name of the student. To set the value of the `fullName` property, we use the following syntax:
```js
student.fullName = 'Rachel Green';
console.log(student.firstName); // Rachel
console.log(student.lastName); // Green
```

## 3. Accessor Properties vs Data Properties
Accessor properties are different from data properties. Here's a comparison between them:

| Data Properties | Accessor Properties |
| --- | --- |
| Data properties are used to store data. | Accessor properties are used to define methods. |
| Data properties are defined using the `=` operator. | Accessor properties are defined using the `get` and `set` keywords. |
| Data properties are accessed using the dot notation or square brackets. | Accessor properties are accessed using the dot notation. |
