# JavaScript for...in loop

The for...in loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.

## - for...in Loop Syntax

Its syntax is:

```js

for (variable in object) {

  // code block to be executed

}

```

1. The variable is used to store the property name of the object.

2. The object is the object whose properties are to be iterated.

3. The code block is executed for each property of the object.

For example,

```js

const person = {

  name: "John",

  age: 30,

  city: "New York"

};

for (property in person) {

  console.log(property);

}

// name

// age

// city

```

## - for...in Loop with Arrays

The for...in loop can also be used to loop through the elements of an array.


```js

const words = ["hello", "world", "welcome"];

for (index in words) {

  console.log(index);

}

// 0

// 1

// 2

```

## - for...in Loop with Objects

The for...in loop can also be used to loop through the properties of an object.


```js

const person = {

  name: "John",

  age: 30,

  city: "New York"

};

for (property in person) {

  console.log(property);

}

// name

// age

// city

```
