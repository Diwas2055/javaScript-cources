# JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators

## JavaScript Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare two values and give back a boolean value: either true or false. Comparison operators are used in decision making and loops.

|Operator|	Description	|Example|
|---|---|---|
|==|	Equal to: true if the operands are equal|	5==5; //true|
|!=|	Not equal to: true if the operands are not equal|	5!=5; //false|
|===|	Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type|	5==='5'; //false|
|!==|	Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all|	5!=='5'; //true|
|`>`|	Greater than: true if the left operand is greater than the right operand|	3>2; //true|
|`>=`|	Greater than or equal to: true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand|	3>=3; //true|
|<|	Less than: true if the left operand is less than the right operand	|3<2; //false|
|<=|	Less than or equal to: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand|	2<=2; //true|

## JavaScript Logical Operators
Logical operators perform logical operations: AND, OR and NOT.

|Operator|	Description	|Example|
|---|---|---|
|&&|	Logical AND: true if both the operands/boolean values are true, else evaluates to false|	true && false; // false
| |	Logical OR: true if either of the operands/boolean values is true. evaluates to false | if both are false	true || false; // true
|!	|Logical NOT: true if the operand is false and vice-versa.|	!true; // false
