# JavaScript if...else Statement
In JavaScript, there are three forms of the if...else statement.

- if statement
- if...else statement
- if...else if...else statement

## 1. JavaScript if Statement
The syntax of the if statement is:
```js
if (condition) {
    // the body of if
}
```
The `if` statement evaluates the condition inside the parenthesis `()`.

1. If the condition is evaluated to true, the code inside the body of if is executed.
2. If the condition is evaluated to false, the code inside the body of if is skipped.

> Note: The `code inside { }` is the body of the if statement.

For example,
```js
// check if the number is positive

const number = prompt("Enter a number: ");

// check if number is greater than 0
if (number > 0) {
 // the body of the if statement
  console.log("The number is positive");
}

console.log("The if statement is easy");
```
## 2. JavaScript if...else statement
An if statement can have an optional else clause. The syntax of the if...else statement is:
```js
if (condition) {
    // block of code if condition is true
} else {
   // block of code if condition is false
}
```
The if..else statement evaluates the condition inside the parenthesis.

If the condition is evaluated to true,

1. the code inside the body of `if` is executed
2. the code inside the body of `else` is skipped from execution

If the condition is evaluated to false,

1. the code inside the body of `else` is executed
2. the code inside the body of `if` is skipped from execution

For example,
```js
// check if the number is positive or negative/zero

const number = prompt("Enter a number: ");

// check if number is greater than 0
if (number > 0) {
  console.log("The number is positive");
}
// if number is not greater than 0
else {
  console.log("The number is either a negative number or 0");
}

console.log("The if...else statement is easy");
```

## 3. JavaScript if...else if...else statement
The if...else statement is used to execute a block of code among two alternatives. However, if you need to make a choice between more than two alternatives, if...else if...else can be used.

The syntax of the if...else if...else statement is:
```js
if (condition1) {
    // code block 1
} else if (condition2){
    // code block 2
} else {
    // code block 3
}
```
1. If condition1 evaluates to true, the code block 1 is executed.
2. If condition1 evaluates to false, then condition2 is evaluated.
    - If the condition2 is true, the code block 2 is executed.
    - If the condition2 is false, the code block 3 is executed.

For example,
```js
// check if the number if positive, negative or zero
const number = prompt("Enter a number: ");


// check if number is greater than 0
if (number > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive");
}
// check if number is 0
else if (number == 0) {
  console.log("The number is 0");
}
// if number is neither greater than 0, nor zero
else {
    console.log("The number is negative");
}

console.log("The if...else if...else statement is easy");
```

## 4. JavaScript Nested if...else statement
You can also use an if...else statement inside of an if...else statement. This is known as nested if...else statement.

For example,
```js
// check if the number is positive, negative or zero
const number = prompt("Enter a number: ");

if (number >= 0) {
    if (number == 0) {
        console.log("You entered number 0");
    } else {
        console.log("You entered a positive number");
    }
} else {
    console.log("You entered a negative number");
}
```
