# JavaScript Data Types


There are different types of data that we can use in a JavaScript program. For example,
```js
const x = 5;
const y = "Hello";
```
Here,
- `5` is an integer data.
- `"Hello"` is a string data.
#
## JavaScript Data Types
There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. They are:

|Data Types	|Description	|Example|
|---|---|---|
|String|	represents textual data|'hello', "hello world!" etc|
|Number|	an integer or a floating-point number|	3, 3.234, 3e-2 etc.|
|BigInt|	an integer with arbitrary precision|	900719925124740999n , 1n etc.|
|Boolean|	Any of two values: true or false|	true and false|
|undefined|	a data type whose variable is not initialized|	let a;|
|null|	`denotes a null value`|	let a = null;|
|Symbol|	data type whose instances are `unique` and `immutable`|	let value = Symbol('hello');|
|Object|	`key-value` pairs of collection of data|	let student = { };|

Here, all data types except `Object` are `primitive` data types, whereas `Object` is `non-primitive`.
#
> Note: The `Object` data type `(non-primitive type)` can store collections of data, whereas primitive data type can only store a single data.

### 1. JavaScript String
String is used to store text. In JavaScript, strings are surrounded by quotes:

- `Single quotes`: 'Hello'
- `Double quotes`: "Hello"
- `Backticks`: `Hello`

For example,
```js
//strings example
const name = 'ram';
const name1 = "hari";
const result = `The names are ${name} and ${name1}`;
```
`Single quotes` and `double quotes` are practically the same and you can use either of them.

`Backticks` are generally used when you need to include `variables` or `expressions` into a string. This is done by wrapping variables or expressions with `${variable or expression}` as shown above.

### 2. JavaScript Number
Number represents integer and floating numbers (decimals and exponentials). For example,
```js
const number1 = 3;
const number2 = 3.433;
const number3 = 3e5 // 3 * 10^5
```
A number type can also be +Infinity, -Infinity, and `NaN (not a number)`. For example,
```js
const number1 = 3/0;
console.log(number1); // Infinity

const number2 = -3/0;
console.log(number2); // -Infinity

// strings can't be divided by numbers
const number3 = "abc"/3; 
console.log(number3);  // NaN
```
### 3. JavaScript BigInt
In JavaScript, Number type can only represent numbers less than `(253 - 1)` and more than `-(253 - 1)`. However, if you need to use a larger number than that, you can use the `BigInt` data type.

- A `BigInt` number is created by appending n to the end of an integer. For example,
```js
// BigInt value
const value1 = 900719925124740998n;

// Adding two big integers
const result1 = value1 + 1n;
console.log(result1); // "900719925124740999n"

const value2 = 900719925124740998n;

// Error! BitInt and number cannot be added
const result2 = value2 + 1; 
console.log(result2); 
```
### 4. JavaScript Boolean
This data type represents logical entities. Boolean represents one of two values: `true or false`. It is easier to think of it as a `yes/no` switch. For example,
```js
const dataChecked = true;
const valueCounted = false;
```

### 5. JavaScript undefined
The undefined data type represents value that is not assigned. If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined. For example,
```js
let name;
console.log(name); // undefined
```
It is also possible to explicitly assign a variable value undefined. For example,
```js
let name = undefined;
console.log(name); // undefined
```
> Note: It is recommended not to explicitly assign undefined to a variable. Usually, `null` is used to assign 'unknown' or 'empty' value to a variable.

### 6. JavaScript null
In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents empty or unknown value. For example,
```js
const number = null;
```
The code above suggests that the number variable is empty.

> Note: `null` is not the same as NULL or Null.

### 7. JavaScript Symbol
This data type was introduced in a newer version of JavaScript (from ES2015).

A value having the data type `Symbol` can be referred to as a `symbol value`. Symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique. For example,
```js
// two symbols with the same description

const value1 = Symbol('hello');
const value2 = Symbol('hello');
```
Though `value1` and `value2` both contain 'hello', they are different as they are of the `Symbol type`.

### 8. JavaScript Object
An object is a complex data type that allows us to store collections of data. For example,
```js
const student = {
    firstName: 'ram',
    lastName: null,
    class: 10
};
```

### 9. JavaScript Type
JavaScript is a dynamically typed (loosely typed) language. JavaScript automatically determines the variables' data type for you.

It also means that a variable can be of one data type and later it can be changed to another data type. For example,
```js
// data is of undefined type
let data;

// data is of integer type
data = 5;

// data is of string type
data = "JavaScript Programming";
```

### 10. JavaScript typeof
To find the type of a variable, you can use the `typeof` operator. For example,
```js
const name = 'ram';
typeof(name); // returns "string"

const number = 4;
typeof(number); //returns "number"

const valueChecked = true;
typeof(valueChecked); //returns "boolean"

const a = null;
typeof(a); // returns "object"
```
> Notice that `typeof` returned "object" for the null type.
