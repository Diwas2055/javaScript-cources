# JavaScript Variables and Constants / Let

## 1.  JavaScript Variables

In programming, a variable is a container `(storage area)` to hold data. For example,
```js
let num = 5;
```
- Here, num is a `variable`. It's storing `5`.

## 2. JavaScript Declare Variables
In JavaScript, we use either var or let keyword to declare variables. For example,
```js
var x;
let y;
```
- Here, `x` and `y` are variables.

## 3. JavaScript `var` Vs `let`
Both `var` and `let` are used to declare variables. However, there are some differences between them.

|var|let|
|---|---|
|var is used in the older versions of JavaScript| let is the new way of declaring variables starting ES6 (ES2015).|
|var is function scoped (will be discussed in later tutorials). |	let is block scoped (will be discussed in later tutorials).|
|For example, `var x;` |	For example, `let y;` |

> Note: It is recommended we use `let` instead of `var`. However, there are a few browsers that `do not support let`. Visit JavaScript let browser support to learn more.

## 4. JavaScript Constants
The `const` keyword was also introduced in the `ES6(ES2015)` version to create constants. For example,
```js
const x = 5;
```
Once a constant is initialized, we cannot change its value.
```js
const x = 5;
x = 10;  // Error! constant cannot be changed.
console.log(x)
```
Simply, a constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

Also, you cannot declare a constant without initializing it. For example,
```js
const x;  // Error! Missing initializer in const declaration.
x = 5;
console.log(x)
```
> Note: If you are sure that the value of a `variable` won't change throughout the program, it's recommended to use `const`. However, there are a few browsers that do not support const.
