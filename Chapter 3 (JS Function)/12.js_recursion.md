# JavaScript Recursion

Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.

The syntax for recursive function is:
```js
function recurse() {
    // function code
    recurse();
    // function code
}

recurse();
```
Here, the `recurse()` function is a `recursive function`. It is calling itself inside the function.
