# JavaScript Hoisting
`Hoisting` in JavaScript is a behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration. For example,

## 1. JavaScript Hoisting with Variables
```js
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
```
In the above example, the variable `x` is declared after using it. However, it still works because of hoisting. The variable `x` is hoisted to the top of the code. Therefore, the above code is equivalent to:
```js
var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 5;
```
## 2. JavaScript Hoisting with Functions
```js
// function declaration
greet();

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}
```
In the above example, the function `greet()` is declared after using it. However, it still works because of hoisting. The function `greet()` is hoisted to the top of the code. Therefore, the above code is equivalent to:
```js
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}

// function call
greet();
```
## 3. JavaScript Hoisting with Variables and Functions
```js
// function declaration
greet();

// variable declaration
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}
```
In the above example, the function `greet()` is declared after using it. However, it still works because of hoisting. The function `greet()` is hoisted to the top of the code. Therefore, the above code is equivalent to:
```js
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}

// function call
greet();

// variable declaration
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
```
